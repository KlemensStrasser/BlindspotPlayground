# Blindspot Playground (WWDC18 Scholarship Submission, accepted)
## Overview

Video games are so heavily reliant on visuals that making them accessible for blind people is often not even possible. That’s why I’ve created this Playground. Blindspot is a puzzle game thats playable by blind people and gives people with full eye sight an glimpse of how hard it is to solve a puzzle without actually seeing it. 

The game principle is very simple. In each level the player has to drag a character from a start to an end tile. The catch is that all tiles on the 5x5 grid are hidden. To locate the elements, the player has to tap around the screen. This will trigger a voice that tells the player what element was touched and where it is located on the grid. So instead of seeing the elements, the player has to “hear” them to find a path from the start to the end.
