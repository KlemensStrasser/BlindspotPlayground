 # First Steps
 
 Your goal is to drag the character from the start to an end tile. It's that simple! Try it out! ðŸ˜Š

 - Note:
 
    - Whenever an element is touched, the game will tell you what it is and where it is located on the 5x5 grid. The first coordinate is always the row, the second the column.
 
    - When you drag the chracter on a new element, the game tells you the location of that element.
 
    - If you are a VoiceOver user, the game is also fully playable to you.
 
    - Every page consists of three levels that are played consecutively. The game will tell you when the last level is finished.
